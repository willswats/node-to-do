## General Information

I built this project to refresh my mind on everything I learnt through completing [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp) course, this includes; Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and more.

## Features

- Full CRUD functionality
- Full statefulness through MongoDB
- Account creation
- Guest accounts
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Priority level for tasks
- Checkboxes for each task

## Setup

Clone this repo to your desktop and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

After installing the dependencies, run MongoDB locally with `mongod`.

You can then run `npm start` to start the application. You will then be able to access it at localhost:3000
